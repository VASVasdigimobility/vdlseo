### 1. Optimize Mobile Performance

- **Improve Key Metrics:**  
  - **First Contentful Paint (2.2 s) & Largest Contentful Paint (5.0 s):**  
    • Optimize images by serving next-gen formats and preloading critical assets.  
    • Defer offscreen images to save significant payload (up to ~9,844 KiB) and reduce perceived load time.
  - **Total Blocking Time (410 ms) & Speed Index (5.1 s):**  
    • Reduce JavaScript execution time by deferring or asynchronously loading non-critical scripts (potential savings of 2.0 s).  
    • Minimize main-thread work to cut down on long tasks (currently 9 long tasks and 4.4 s of work).

- **Streamline Resource Delivery:**  
  • Eliminate render-blocking resources (savings of ~150 ms).  
  • Trim unused JavaScript (savings of 67 KiB) and optimize network payload (total size ~10,980 KiB).  
  • Reduce third-party code usage that’s impacting interactivity (noted 100 ms blockage).

### 2. Enhance Mobile SEO & Accessibility

- **SEO Score Improvement (currently 66):**  
  • Optimize meta tags, headings, and content structure to ensure mobile-friendly markup.  
  • Implement structured data (schema markup) to aid search engines in content understanding.
  
- **Accessibility Best Practices (score 95):**  
  • Address issues like low-contrast text and heading order, which can indirectly affect user experience and engagement.  
  • Ensure interactive elements are clearly defined for both users and search engine crawlers.

### 3. Prioritize User Experience (UX)

- **Mobile UX:**  
  • Maintain a responsive design that offers clear navigation, fast load times, and intuitive interactions.  
  • Improve tap target sizes and spacing to ensure smooth touch interactions.

- **Content & Layout:**  
  • Keep a clean, well-ordered DOM (noted 810 elements) to speed up rendering and improve mobile interactivity.  
  • Use passive event listeners and optimize animations to avoid layout shifts (CLS remains at 0, so keep it that way).

### 4. Monitor, Test, and Iterate

- **Continuous Testing:**  
  • Regularly run mobile PageSpeed Insights audits and use tools like Google Search Console to monitor Core Web Vitals.  
  • Analyze real-user metrics to adjust strategies promptly and ensure improvements translate into better search rankings.

- **Iterative Optimization:**  
  • Prioritize high-impact fixes first (e.g., LCP, JavaScript execution, render-blocking resources).  
  • After each round of improvements, test again to measure progress and refine your approach.
