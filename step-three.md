### 2. Optimize JavaScript and Main-Thread Work

- **Reduce Execution Time:**  
  • The report indicates a potential to save 2.9 s by reducing JavaScript execution time and minimizing main-thread work (currently 4.7 s).  
  • Addressing 10 long main-thread tasks will further improve responsiveness.

- **Action Steps:**  
  • Audit and defer non-critical scripts.  
  • Consider code-splitting and async loading techniques to ensure that only essential JavaScript runs immediately.

- **Eliminate Render-Blocking:**  
  • Potential savings of 130 ms can be achieved by eliminating render-blocking resources.  
- **Optimize Images:**  
  • Serving images in next-gen formats could save up to 240 KiB, and properly sizing images could save an additional 30 KiB.  
  • Defer offscreen images to save a significant ~9,844 KiB from your total payload (currently 18,158 KiB).

### 4. Enhance Accessibility and SEO

- **Accessibility (Score: 95) & SEO (Score: 86):**  
  • While the site scores well, there are opportunities to improve contrast ratios and correct heading order.  
  • Ensure descriptive link text and semantic HTML to help both users and search engines better understand your content.

- **Action Steps:**  
  • Review and adjust color contrast and heading structures.  
  • Refine meta tags, alt attributes, and canonical tags to boost SEO further.

### 5. Continuous Monitoring and Iteration

- **Regular Audits:**  
  • Keep using tools like PageSpeed Insights and Google Search Console to monitor changes and maintain top performance.  
  • Focus on iterative improvements—each small gain in speed and user experience contributes to higher search rankings and better SEO overall.
