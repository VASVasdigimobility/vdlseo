### 1. Optimize Technical Performance

- **Reduce Network Payloads**  
  The report shows a total page size of 10.7MB. Compress images, minify CSS/JS, and remove unnecessary assets to cut load times.  

- **Streamline JavaScript**  
  With 5.1s spent on executing JavaScript, prioritize deferring non-critical scripts and optimizing existing code to reduce blocking time.

- **Eliminate Render-Blocking Resources**  
  Address the identified render-blocking issues (potential savings of 649ms) by asynchronously loading CSS/JS or using inline critical CSS.

- **Implement a CDN and HTTP/2**  
  With 37 resources flagged for CDN use and potential HTTP/2 savings of 1.3s, distribute content via a CDN and ensure all resources use HTTP/2 to improve load performance.

- **Maintain Stellar Core Metrics**  
  Your LCP is at 1.0s and overall Performance Score is 94%, which is excellent. Continue monitoring these metrics to ensure they remain strong.
